# Practice Implementations — Based on Gerstner's Neuronal Dynamics

This repository contains **practice implementations** of models and concepts
from the textbook *Neuronal Dynamics: From Single Neurons to Networks and Models
of Cognition* by Wulfram Gerstner et al., and the related online course.

The purpose of this repository is **purely educational**.  
All code is **written by me from scratch** as a way to understand and practice
the material.  

This repository is **not affiliated with the authors or EPFL**.
